In a listening experiment participants rated the perceived coloration of a synthesized point source compared to the reference case of a single loudspeaker. The point source was presented by two-channel stereophony and Wave Field Synthesis applying a circular loudspeaker array ranging from 14 up to 3 584 loudspeakers. Test...},
